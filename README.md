# hood.exe

Token launchpad for Robinhood Chain in a Luna-style desktop. Launches and trades route to Pons V2.

- Spec: [docs/BRIEF.md](docs/BRIEF.md) (v1.0 + v1.1 merged; v1.1 wins on conflicts)
- Deploying: [docs/DEPLOY.md](docs/DEPLOY.md) (Vercel, Railway, self-hosted indexer)
- Original briefs: `hood-exe-dev-brief.md` (v1.0), `hood.exe_developer_briefv1.1.md` (v1.1)

## Layout

```
apps/web/          Next.js 16.4 frontend (Vercel)
apps/api/          Fastify 5 API: SIWE sessions, rigor scoring, IPFS pinning, launch records, Explore, charts and trades (Railway)
apps/indexer/      Envio HyperIndex: Pons V2 launches, curve trades, candles, graduations, wallet positions (self-hosted on Railway)
packages/shared/   Chain config, Pons V2 ABIs and quote maths, zod schemas, shared helpers
```

The worker (`apps/api/src/worker.ts`) ships in the API image as a second Railway service.

## What works

- **Desktop**: boot screen, draggable windows, taskbar, Start menu, Shut Down; XP-skinned RainbowKit on chain 4663.
- **Launch.exe**: three-page wizard (identity, theorem with live KaTeX preview and rigor score, economics), then a review page with curve preview and dev-buy quote. Signs in with SIWE, pins to IPFS, launches via `launchToken` or `launchAndBuy`.
- **Explore.exe**: "hood.exe launches" / "All Pons" tabs, sort by Latest, Volume, Rigor or MCap.
- **Token Detail**: candle chart (1m–1d), last trades, graduation progress, and curve buy/sell with approvals, slippage and snipe-tax handling. Graduated coins link out to Pons.
- **Callouts.exe**: live feed with reactions and nicknames; tray balloons when it is closed.
- **Portfolio**: holdings marked at the curve price with unrealized P&L (average cost from indexed trades), sort by Rigor, Value or P&L %, Export CSV; "My launches" tab. Rows open Token Detail.
- **Share links**: `/t/0x…` opens the desktop on that coin, with its own link-preview card. Token Detail has Copy link and Post on X.
- **Legal**: one-time risk dialog before the first launch or trade; Terms, Risk and Privacy windows (drafts pending legal review).
- **Games**: a Games folder on the desktop and in Start → Games. Solitaire (Klondike, turn one) with drag and drop on mouse and touch, undo, scoring, statistics, resume and the bouncing-card win; Minesweeper is a "coming soon" window. `/games/solitaire` and `/games/minesweeper` open them directly. No wallet needed.
- **Analytics**: PostHog, anonymous and cookieless, with the launch and trade funnels (`apps/web/lib/analytics.ts`).

## Develop

Requires Node 20.9+, pnpm 11 and Docker (for the API's Postgres and Redis).

```bash
pnpm install
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local   # set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8787
pnpm dev                                       # http://localhost:3000
pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm build
```

Without `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` the wallet modal offers browser-injected and Coinbase wallets only.

### API

```bash
docker compose up -d                           # Postgres 17 on :54320, Redis 7 on :63790
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env
pnpm dev:api                                   # http://localhost:8787, migrations run on start
pnpm --filter @hood/api dev:worker             # system callouts every 10 s (needs REDIS_URL)
```

Open the web app on `localhost`, not `127.0.0.1`, so the session cookie reaches the API.

- Without `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` every statement comes back unscored (grey badge).
- Without `PINATA_JWT` a dev pinner computes CIDs locally and publishes nothing.
- Production refuses to start on either stand-in, without Redis, or with the dev session secret.
- API tests run on in-process Postgres (PGlite) and need no Docker.
- Schema changes: edit `apps/api/src/db/schema.ts`, then `pnpm --filter @hood/api db:generate`.
- Callouts: `GET/POST /callouts`, reactions, `PUT /profile` (nickname) and the `/ws` live feed. The worker (same package, `src/worker.ts`) posts "$TICKER launched / graduated" and ≥ 0.5 ETH buys for hood.exe coins and reaches the API's WebSockets through Redis pub/sub; on Railway run it as a second service from the same image. Without `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` callout moderation is the blocklist only (refused in production). `OFFICIAL_WALLETS` and `BLOCKLIST_EXTRA` are comma-separated.
- Explore's `/tokens` table: launches come from the indexer (`ENVIO_GRAPHQL_URL`); names, logos and live reserves from `RPC_URL_SERVER` (eth_call only, so a free-tier RPC is fine). Without `ENVIO_GRAPHQL_URL` the API falls back to scanning RPC logs, which free RPC tiers cap at a few blocks. `TOKEN_INDEX=off` disables it.
- Token Detail's chart (`/tokens/:address/candles`), trades (`/tokens/:address/trades`) and Explore's Volume sort read the indexer directly; without `ENVIO_GRAPHQL_URL` the first two answer 503 and Volume is hidden.
- Portfolio (`/portfolio/:wallet`): the wallet's launches plus its holdings, marked at the curve price, with average-cost P&L from its indexed trades. Without `ENVIO_GRAPHQL_URL` it only covers the wallet's own launches and has no cost basis; graduated coins have no value yet.

### Indexer (Envio)

envio ships no Windows build, so on Windows the indexer runs in Docker (the `indexer` compose profile); on Linux/macOS it runs natively. `apps/indexer/.env` needs `ENVIO_API_TOKEN` (a HyperSync token from envio.dev/app/api-tokens; the free package allows 5 requests/min).

```bash
docker compose --profile indexer up -d   # indexer (config.dev.yaml: starts near the chain head) + Hasura GraphQL on :8080
pnpm --filter @hood/indexer test         # handler tests (in the container on Windows)
pnpm --filter @hood/indexer codegen      # after editing config*.yaml or schema.graphql
```

Production deploys `config.yaml` (from the V2 factory's deployment, block 26,841,846) to Envio's hosted service: install the Envio Deployments GitHub app on this repo, root directory `apps/indexer`, then set the API's `ENVIO_GRAPHQL_URL` to the endpoint it gives you.

### Local chain (fork of 4663)

Needs [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh)'s `anvil` (on PATH, in `~/.foundry/bin`, or `ANVIL=…`).

```bash
pnpm fork             # Robinhood Chain with live Pons V2 on http://127.0.0.1:8545
pnpm fork --refresh   # re-fork mainnet (new launch terms or pair tokens)
```

The public RPC only keeps ~10 minutes of state, so `pnpm fork` forks once, runs every launch path the wizard uses (including a dev buy that fills the curve), saves the state to `.fork/`, and serves that snapshot with no upstream. Each run starts from the snapshot.

To launch from the wizard against it, with no browser wallet needed:

```bash
# apps/web/.env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8787
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8545
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_WALLET=1        # adds "Anvil dev wallet" (anvil signs for it); only with a localhost RPC
# apps/api/.env
RPC_URL_SERVER=http://127.0.0.1:8545
```

The four anvil dev accounts get 10,000 ETH and 10,000 USDG each. A real wallet works too: add a network with chain id 4663 and RPC `http://127.0.0.1:8545`, and import an anvil dev key. Blockscout links in the wizard point at mainnet and won't resolve fork transactions.

### Chain checks

Read-only against chain 4663; nothing is sent.

```bash
pnpm --filter @hood/shared check:pons        # addresses, ABIs, launch terms, quote vs. contract
pnpm --filter @hood/shared simulate:launch   # wizard launch txs via eth_call, dev-buy quote vs. fill
pnpm --filter @hood/shared sync:pairs        # regenerate the approved pair-token list
```
